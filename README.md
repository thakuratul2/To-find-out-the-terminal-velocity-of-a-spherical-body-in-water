### About the Experiment 
In fluid flow there is a transfer of momentum which gives rise to a tangential stress or drag on a smooth surface that is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This is called skin drag. In addition to this, additional friction losses occur because of acceleration & deceleration of fluid. The accelerative effects occur when the fluid changes its path to pass around a solid body set in the flow path. This phenomenon is known as form drag.

Under gravitational field, the motion of a particle through a fluid is due to the density difference between the particle and the fluid. Consider the motion of a spherical particle of diameter dp density through a fluid of viscosity and density.
